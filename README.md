## requires

* serialosc 1.2a (nov 2012)
* chuck version 1.2.1.3 (nov 2009) or later

## notes

* after installing chuck, setup should be easy. chili will autodetect your monome and its size.
* to get chuck, go to http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/release/
* the terminal form of chuck is easier and prettier than the graphical form. all you need to do is change to the chili directory and say "chuck chili.ck"
